			<p>A course of lectures, if it is to be more than a collection of remarks, must have an idea running through it. It must also have a subject, and the idea ought to run through the subject too. This is so obvious as to sound foolish, but anyone who has tried to lecture will realize that here is a genuine difficulty. A course, like any other collection of words, generates an atmosphere. It has its own apparatus⁠—a lecturer, an audience or provision for one, it occurs at regular intervals, it is announced by printed notices, and it has a financial side, though this last is tactfully concealed. Thus it tends in its parasitic way to lead a life of its own, and it and the idea running through it are apt to move in one direction while the subject steals off in the other.</p>
			<p>The idea running through these lectures is by now plain enough: that there are in the novel two forces: human beings and a bundle of various things not human beings, and that it is the novelist’s business to adjust these two forces and conciliate their claims. That is plain enough, but does it run through the novel too? Perhaps our subject, namely the books we have read, has stolen away from us while we theorize, like a shadow from an ascending bird. The bird is all right⁠—it climbs, it is consistent and eminent. The shadow is all right⁠—it has flickered across roads and gardens. But the two things resemble one another less and less, they do not touch as they did when the bird rested its toes on the ground. Criticism, especially a critical course, is so misleading. However lofty its intentions and sound its method, its subject slides away from beneath it, imperceptibly away, and lecturer and audience may awake with a start to find that they are carrying on in a distinguished and intelligent manner, but in regions which have nothing to do with anything they have read.</p>
			<p>It was this that was worrying Gide, or rather one of the things that was worrying him, for he has an anxious mind. When we try to translate truth out of one sphere into another, whether from life into books or from books into lectures, something happens to truth, it goes wrong, not suddenly when it might be detected, but slowly. That long passage from <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book" xml:lang="fr">Les Faux Monnayeurs</i> already quoted, may recall the bird to its shadow. It is not possible, after it, to apply the old apparatus any more. There is more in the novel than time or people or logic or any of their derivatives, more even than Fate. And by “more” I do not mean something that excludes these aspects nor something that includes them, embraces them. I mean something that cuts across them like a bar of light, that is intimately connected with them at one place and patiently illumines all their problems, and at another place shoots over or through them as if they did not exist. We shall give that bar of light two names, fantasy and prophecy.</p>
			<p>The novels we have now to consider all tell a story, contain characters, and have plots or bits of plots, so we could apply to them the apparatus suited for Fielding or Arnold Bennett. But when I say two of their names⁠—<i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Tristram Shandy</i> and <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Moby Dick</i>⁠—it is clear that we must stop and think a moment. The bird and the shadow are too far apart. A new formula must be found: the mere fact that one can mention Tristram and Moby in a single sentence shows it. What an impossible pair! As far apart as the poles. Yes. And like the poles they have one thing in common, which the lands round the equator do not share: an axis. What is essential in Sterne and Melville belongs to this new aspect of fiction: the fantastic-prophetical axis. George Meredith touched it: he was somewhat fantastic. So did Charlotte Brontë: she was a prophetess occasionally. But in neither of these was it essential. Deprive them of it, and a book remains which still resembles <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Harry Richmond</i> or <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Shirley</i>. Deprive Sterne or Melville of it, deprive Peacock or Max Beerbohm or Virginia Woolf or Walter de la Mare or William Beckford or James Joyce or <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">D. H.</abbr> Lawrence or Swift, and nothing is left at all.</p>
			<p>Our easiest approach to a definition of any aspect of fiction is always by considering the sort of demand it makes on the reader. Curiosity for the story, human feelings and a sense of value for the characters, intelligence and memory for the plot. What does fantasy ask of us? It asks us to pay something extra. It compels us to an adjustment that is different to an adjustment required by a work of art, to an additional adjustment. The other novelists say “Here is something that might occur in your lives,” the fantasist says “Here’s something that could not occur. I must ask you first to accept my book as a whole, and secondly to accept certain things in my book.” Many readers can grant the first request, but refuse the second. “One knows a book isn’t real,” they say, “still one does expect it to be natural, and this angel or midget or ghost or silly delay about the child’s birth⁠—no, it is too much.” They either retract their original concession and stop reading, or if they do go on it is with complete coldness, and they watch the gambols of the author without realizing how much they may mean to him.</p>
			<p>No doubt the above approach is not critically sound. We all know that a work of art is an entity, <abbr>etc.</abbr>, <abbr>etc.</abbr>; it has its own laws which are not those of daily life, anything that suits it is true, so why should any question arise about the angel, <abbr>etc.</abbr>, except whether it is suitable to its book? Why place an angel on a different basis from a stockbroker? Once in the realm of the fictitious, what difference is there between an apparition and a mortgage? I see the soundness of this argument, but my heart refuses to assent. The general tone of novels is so literal that when the fantastic is introduced it produces a special effect: some readers are thrilled, others choked off: it demands an additional adjustment because of the oddness of its method or subject matter⁠—like a sideshow in an exhibition where you have to pay sixpence as well as the original entrance fee. Some readers pay with delight, it is only for the sideshows that they entered the exhibition, and it is only to them I can now speak. Others refuse with indignation, and these have our sincere regards, for to dislike the fantastic in literature is not to dislike literature. It does not even imply poverty of imagination, only a disinclination to meet certain demands that are made on it. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Asquith (if gossip is correct) could not meet the demands made on him by <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Lady Into Fox</i>. He should not have objected, he said, if the fox had become a lady again, but as it was he was left with an uncomfortable dissatisfied feeling. This feeling reflects no discredit either upon an eminent politician or a charming book. It merely means that <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Asquith, though a genuine lover of literature, could not pay the additional sixpence⁠—or rather he was willing to pay it but hoped to get it back again at the end.</p>
			<p>So fantasy asks us to pay something extra.</p>
			<p>Let us now distinguish between fantasy and prophecy.</p>
			<p>They are alike in having gods, and unlike in the gods they have. There is in both the sense of mythology which differentiates them from other aspects of our subject. An invocation is again possible, therefore on behalf of fantasy let us now invoke all beings who inhabit the lower air, the shallow water, and the smaller hills, all Fauns and Dryads and slips of the memory, all verbal coincidences, Pans and puns, all that is medieval this side of the grave. When we come to prophecy, we shall utter no invocation, but it will have been to whatever transcends our abilities, even when it is human passion that transcends them, to the deities of India, Greece, Scandinavia and Judaea, to all that is medieval beyond the grave and to Lucifer son of the morning. By their mythologies we shall distinguish these two sorts of novels.</p>
			<p>A number of rather small gods then should haunt us today⁠—I would call them fairies if the word were not consecrated to imbecility. (Do you believe in fairies? No, not under any circumstances.) The stuff of daily life will be tugged and strained in various directions, the earth will be given little tilts mischievous or pensive, spot lights will fall on objects that have no reason to anticipate or welcome them, and tragedy herself, though not excluded, will have a fortuitous air as if a word would disarm her. The power of fantasy penetrates into every corner of the universe, but not into the forces that govern it⁠—the stars that are the brain of heaven, the army of unalterable law, remain untouched⁠—and novels of this type have an improvised air, which is the secret of their force and charm. They may contain solid character-drawing, penetrating and bitter criticism of conduct and civilization; yet our simile of the beam of light must remain, and if one god must be invoked specially, let us call upon Hermes⁠—messenger, thief, and conductor of souls to a not too terrible hereafter.</p>
			<p>You will expect me now to say that a fantastic book asks us to accept the supernatural. I will say it, but reluctantly, because any statement as to their subject matter brings these novels into the claws of critical apparatus, from which it is important that they should be saved. It is truer of them than of most books that we can only know what is in them by reading them, and their appeal is specially personal⁠—they are sideshows inside the main show. So I would rather hedge as much as possible, and say that they ask us to accept either the supernatural or its absence.</p>
			<p>A reference to the greatest of the them⁠—<i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Tristram Shandy</i>⁠—will make this point clear. The supernatural is absent from the Shandy ménage, yet a thousand incidents suggest that it is not far off. It would not be really odd, would it, if the furniture in <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Shandy’s bedroom, where he retired in despair after hearing the omitted details of his son’s birth, should come alive like Belinda’s toilette in <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">The Rape of the Lock</i>, or that Uncle Toby’s drawbridge should lead into Lilliput? There is a charmed stagnation about the whole epic⁠—the more the characters do the less gets done, the less they have to say the more they talk, the harder they think the softer they get, facts have an unholy tendency to unwind and trip up the past instead of begetting the future, as in well-conducted books, and the obstinacy of inanimate objects, like <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Slop’s bag, is most suspicious. Obviously a god is hidden in <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Tristram Shandy</i>, his name is Muddle, and some readers cannot accept him. Muddle is almost incarnate⁠—quite to reveal his awful features was not Sterne’s intention; that is the deity that lurks behind his masterpiece⁠—the army of unutterable muddle, the universe as a hot chestnut. Small wonder that another divine muddler, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Johnson, writing in 1776, should remark, “Nothing odd will do long: <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Tristram Shandy</i> did not last!” Doctor Johnson was not always happy in his literary judgments, but the appropriateness of this one passes belief.</p>
			<p>Well, that must serve as our definition of fantasy. It implies the supernatural, but need not express it. Often it does express it, and were that type of classification helpful, we could make a list of the devices which writers of a fantastic turn have used⁠—such as the introduction of a god, ghost, angel, monkey, monster, midget, witch into ordinary life; or the introduction of ordinary men into no man’s land, the future, the past, the interior of the earth, the fourth dimension; or divings into and dividings of personality; or finally the device of parody or adaptation. These devices need never grow stale; they will occur naturally to writers of a certain temperament, and be put to fresh use; but the fact that their number is strictly limited is of interest; and suggests that the beam of light can only be manipulated in certain ways.</p>
			<p>I will select, as a typical example, a recent book about a witch: <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Flecker’s Magic</i>, by Norman Matson. It seemed to me good and I recommended it to a friend whose judgment I respect. He thought it poor. That is what is so tiresome about new books; they never give us that restful feeling which we have when perusing the classics. <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Flecker’s Magic</i> contains scarcely anything that is new⁠—fantasies cannot: only the old old story of the wishing ring which brings either misery or nothing at all. Flecker, an American boy who is learning to paint in Paris, is given the ring by a girl in a café; she is a witch, she tells him; he has only to be sure what he wants and he will get it. To prove her power, a motorbus rises slowly from the street and turns upside down in the air. The passengers, who do not fall out, try to look as if nothing was happening. The driver, who is standing on the pavement at the moment, cannot conceal his surprise, but when his bus returns safe to earth again he thinks it wiser to get into his seat and drive off as usual. Motorbuses do not revolve slowly through the air⁠—so they do not. Flecker now accepts the ring. His character, though slightly sketched, is individual, and this definiteness causes the book to grip.</p>
			<p>It proceeds with a growing tension, a series of little shocks. The method is Socratic. The boy starts by thinking of something obvious, like a Rolls-Royce. But where shall he put the beastly thing? Or a beautiful lady. But what about her <i xml:lang="fr">carte d’identité</i>? Or money? Ah, that’s more like it⁠—he is almost a beggar. Say a million dollars. He prepares to turn the ring for this wish⁠—except while one’s about it two millions seem safer⁠—or ten⁠—or⁠—and money blares out into madness, and the same thing happens when he thinks of long life: to die in forty years⁠—no, in fifty⁠—in one hundred⁠—horrible, horrible. Then a solution occurs. He has always wanted to be a great painter. Well, he’ll be it at once. But what kind of greatness? Giotto’s? Cézanne’s? Certainly not; his own kind, and he does not know what that is, so this wish likewise is impossible.</p>
			<p>And now a horrible old woman begins to haunt his days and dreams. She reminds him vaguely of the girl who gave him the ring. She knows his thoughts and she is always sidling up to him in the streets and saying, “Dear boy⁠—darling boy⁠—wish for happiness.” We learn in time that she is the real witch⁠—the girl was a human acquaintance whom she used to get into touch with Flecker. The last of the witches⁠—very lonely. The rest have committed suicide during the eighteenth century⁠—they could not endure to survive into the world of Newton where two and two make four, and even the world of Einstein is not sufficiently decentralised to revive them. She has hung on in the hope of smashing this world, and she wants the boy to ask for happiness because such a wish has never been made in all the history of the ring.</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>Perhaps Flecker was the first modern man to find himself in this predicament? The people of the old world had so little they knew surely what they wanted. They knew about Almighty God, who wore a beard and sat in an armchair about a mile above the fields, and life was very short and very long too, for the days were so full of unthinking effort.</p>
				<p>The people of the recorded olden times wished for a beautiful castle on a high hill and lived therein until death. But the hill was not so high one might see from the windows back along thirty centuries⁠—as one may from a bungalow. In the castle there were no great volumes filled with words and pictures of things dug up by man’s relentless curiosity from sand and soil in all comers of the world; there was a sentimental half-belief in dragons, but no knowledge that once upon a time only dragons had lived on the earth⁠—that man’s grandfather and grandmother were dragons; there were no movies flickering like thoughts against a white wall, no phonograph, no machinery with which to achieve the sensation of speed; no diagrams of the fourth dimension, no contrasts in life like that of Waterville, <abbr epub:type="z3998:place">MN</abbr>, and Paris, France. In the castle the light was weak and flickering, hallways were dark, rooms deeply shadowed. The little outside world was full of shadow, and on the very top of the mind of him who lived in the castle played a dim light⁠—underneath were shadows, fear, ignorance, will-to-ignorance. Most of all, there was not in the castle on the hill the breathless sense of imminent revelation⁠—that today or surely tomorrow Man would at a stroke double his power and change the world again.</p>
				<p>The ancient tales of magic were the mumbling thoughts of a distant shabby little world⁠—so, at least, thought Flecker, offended. The tales gave him no guidance. There was too much difference between his world and theirs.</p>
				<p>He wondered if he hadn’t dismissed the wish for happiness rather heedlessly? He seemed to get nowhere thinking about it. He was not wise enough. In the old tales a wish for happiness was never made! He wondered why.</p>
				<p>He might chance it⁠—just to see what would happen. The thought made him tremble. He leaped from his bed and paced the red-tiled floor, rubbing his hands together.</p>
				<p>“I want to be happy forever,” he whispered, to hear the words, careful not to touch the ring. “<em>Happy⁠ ⁠… forever</em>”⁠—the two syllables of the first word, like hard little pebbles, struck musically against the bell of his imagination, but the second was a sigh. <em>Forever</em>⁠—his spirit sank under the soft heavy impact of it. Held in his thought the word made a dreary music, fading. “<em>Happy forever</em>”⁠—<strong>No</strong>!!</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>Thus again and again⁠—the mark of the true fantasist⁠—does Norman Matson merge the kingdoms of magic and common sense by using words that apply to both, and the mixture he has created comes alive. I will not tell the end of the story. You will have guessed its essentials, but there are always surprises in the working of a fresh mind, and to the end of time good literature will be made round this notion of a wish.</p>
			<p>To turn from this simple example of the supernatural to a more complicated one⁠—to a highly accomplished and superbly written book whose spirit is farcical: <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Zuleika Dobson</i> by Max Beerbohm. You all know Miss Dobson⁠—not personally, or you would not be here now. She is that damsel for love of whom all the undergraduates of Oxford except one drowned themselves during Eights week, and he threw himself out of a window.</p>
			<p>A superb theme for a fantasy, but all will depend on the handling. It is treated with a mixture of realism, wittiness, charm and mythology, and the mythology is most important. Max has borrowed or created a number of supernatural machines⁠—to have entrusted Zuleika to one of them would be inept; the fantasy would become heavy or thin. But we pass from the sweating emperors to the black and pink pearls, the hooting owls, the interference of the Muse Clio, the ghosts of Chopin and George Sand, of Nellie O’Mora; just as one fails another starts, to uphold this gayest and most exquisite of funeral palls.</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>Through the square, across the High, down Grove Street they passed. The Duke looked up at the tower of Merton, <i xml:lang="grc">ώς οὔποτ’ αὗθις ἀλλὰ νῦν πανύστατον</i>. Strange that tonight it would still be standing here, in all its sober and solid beauty⁠—still be gazing, over the roofs and chimneys, at the tower of Magdalen, its rightful bride. Through untold centuries of the future it would stand thus, gaze thus. He winced. Oxford walls have a way of belittling us; and the Duke was loth to regard his doom as trivial.</p>
				<p>Aye, by all minerals we are mocked. Vegetables, yearly deciduous, are far more sympathetic. The lilac and laburnum, making lovely now the railed pathway to Christ Church meadow, were all a-swaying and nodding to the Duke as he passed by. “Adieu, adieu, your Grace,” they were whispering. “We are very sorry for you, very sorry indeed. We never dared suppose you would predecease us. We think your death a very great tragedy. Adieu! Perhaps we shall meet in another world⁠—that is, if the members of the animal kingdom have immortal souls, as we have.”</p>
				<p>The Duke was little versed in their language; yet, as he passed between these gently garrulous blooms, he caught at the least the drift of their salutation, and smiled a vague but courteous acknowledgment, to the right and the left alternately, creating a very favourable impression.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>Has not a passage like this⁠—with its freedom of invocation⁠—a beauty unattainable by serious literature? It is so funny and charming, so iridescent yet so profound. Criticisms of human nature fly through the book, not like arrows but upon the wings of sylphs. Towards the end⁠—that dreadful end often so fatal to fiction⁠—the book rather flags: the suicide of all the undergraduates of Oxford is not as delightful as it ought to be when viewed at close quarters, and the defenestration of Noaks almost nasty. Still it is a great work⁠—the most consistent achievement of fantasy in our time, and the closing scene in Zuleika’s bedroom with its menace of further disasters is impeccable.</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>And now with pent breath and fast-beating heart, she stared at the lady of the mirror, without seeing her; and now she wheeled round and swiftly glided to that little table on which stood her two books. She snatched Bradshaw.</p>
				<p>We always intervene between Bradshaw and anyone whom we see consulting him. “Mademoiselle will permit me to find that which she seeks?” asked Melisande.</p>
				<p>“Be quiet,” said Zuleika. We always repulse, at first, anyone who intervenes between us and Bradshaw.</p>
				<p>We always end by accepting the intervention. “See if it is possible to go direct from here to Cambridge,” said Zuleika, handing the book on. “If it isn’t, then⁠—well, see how one <em>does</em> get there.”</p>
				<p>We never have any confidence in the intervener. Nor is the intervener, when it comes to the point, sanguine. With mistrust mounting to exasperation Zuleika sat watching the faint and frantic researches of her maid.</p>
				<p>“Stop!” she said suddenly. “I have a much better idea. Go down very early to the station. See the stationmaster. Order me a special train. For ten o’clock, say.”</p>
				<p>Rising, she stretched her arms above her head. Her lips parted in a yawn, met in a smile. With both hands she pushed back her hair from her shoulders, and twisted it into a loose knot. Very lightly she slipped up into bed, and very soon she was asleep.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>So Zuleika ought to have come on to this place. She does not seem ever to have arrived and we can only suppose that through the intervention of the gods her special train failed to start, or, more likely, is still in a siding at Bletchley.</p>
			<p>Among the devices in my list I mentioned “parody” or “adaptation” and would now examine this further. The fantasist here adopts for his mythology some earlier work and uses it as a framework or quarry for his own purposes. There is an aborted example of this in <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Joseph Andrews</i>. Fielding set out to use <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Pamela</i> as a comic mythology. He thought it would be fun to invent a brother to Pamela, a pure-minded footman, who should repulse Lady Booby’s attentions just as Pamela had repulsed <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> <abbr epub:type="z3998:surname">B.</abbr>’s, and he made Lady Booby <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> <abbr epub:type="z3998:surname">B.</abbr>’s aunt. Thus he would be able to laugh at Richardson, and incidentally express his own views of life. Fielding’s view of life however was of the sort that only rests content with the creation of solid round characters, and with the growth of Parson Adams and <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Slipslop the fantasy ceases, and we get an independent work. <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Joseph Andrews</i> (which is also important historically) is interesting to us as an example of a false start. Its author begins by playing the fool in a Richardsonian world, and ends by being serious in a world of his own⁠—the world of Tom Jones and Amelia.</p>
			<p>Parody or adaptation have enormous advantages to certain novelists, particularly to those who may have a great deal to say and plenty of literary genius, but who do not see the world in terms of individual men and women⁠—who do not, in other words, take easily to creating characters. How are such men to start writing? An already existing book or literary tradition may inspire them⁠—they may find high up in its cornices a pattern that will serve as a beginning, they may swing about in its rafters and gain strength. That fantasy of Lowes Dickinson, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Magic Flute</i>, seems to be created thus: it has taken as its mythology the world of Mozart. Tamino, Sarastro, and the Queen of the Night stand in their enchanted kingdom ready for the author’s thoughts, and when these are poured in they become alive and a new and exquisite work is born. And the same is true of another fantasy, anything but exquisite⁠—James Joyce’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Ulysses</i><a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6" id="noteref-6" epub:type="noteref">6</a> That remarkable affair⁠—perhaps the most interesting literary experiment of our day⁠—could not have been achieved unless Joyce had had, as his guide and butt, the world of the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Odyssey</i>.</p>
			<p>I am only touching on one aspect of <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Ulysses</i>: it is of course more than a fantasy⁠—it is a dogged attempt to cover the universe with mud, it is an inverted Victorianism, an attempt to make crossness and dirt succeed where sweetness and light failed, a simplification of the human character in the interests of Hell. All simplifications are fascinating, all lead us away from the truth (which lies far nearer the muddle of <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Tristram Shandy</i>), and <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Ulysses</i> must not detain us on the ground that it contains a morality⁠—otherwise we shall also have to discuss <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Humphry Ward. We are concerned with it because, through a mythology, Joyce has been able to create the peculiar stage and characters he required.</p>
			<p>The action of those 400,000 words occupies a single day, the scene is Dublin, the theme is a journey⁠—the modern man’s journey from morn to midnight, from bed to the squalid tasks of mediocrity, to a funeral, newspaper office, library, pub, lavatory, lying-in hospital, a saunter by the beach, brothel, coffee stall, and so back to bed. And it coheres because it depends from the journey of a hero through the seas of Greece, like a bat hanging to a cornice.</p>
			<p>Ulysses himself is <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Leopold Bloom⁠—a converted Jew⁠—greedy, lascivious, timid, undignified, desultory, superficial, kindly and always at his lowest when he pretends to aspire. He tries to explore life through the body. Penelope is <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Marion Bloom, an overblown soprano, by no means harsh to her suitors. The third character is young Stephen Dedalus, whom Bloom recognizes as his spiritual son much as Ulysses recognizes Telemachus as his actual son. Stephen tries to explore life through the intellect⁠—we have met him before in <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">The Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</i>, and now he is worked into this epic of grubbiness and disillusion. He and Bloom meet halfway through in Night Town (which corresponds partly to Homer’s Palace of Circe, partly to his Descent into Hell) and in its supernatural and filthy alleys they strike up their slight but genuine friendship. This is the crisis of the book, and here⁠—and indeed throughout⁠—smaller mythologies swarm and pullulate, like vermin between the scales of a poisonous snake. Heaven and earth fill with infernal life, personalities melt, sexes interchange, until the whole universe, including poor, pleasure-loving <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Bloom, is involved in one joyless orgy.</p>
			<p>Does it come off? No, not quite. Indignation in literature never quite comes off either in Juvenal or Swift or Joyce; there is something in words that is alien to its simplicity. The Night Town scene does not come off except as a superfetation of fantasies, a monstrous coupling of reminiscences. Such satisfaction as can be attained in this direction is attained, and all through the bode we have similar experiments⁠—the aim of which is to degrade all things and more particularly civilization and art, by turning them inside out and upside down. Some enthusiasts may think that <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Ulysses</i> ought to be mentioned not here but later on, under the heading of prophecy, and I understand this criticism. But I prefer to mention it today with <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Tristram Shandy</i>, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Flecker’s Magic</i>, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Zuleika Dobson</i>, and <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">The Magic Flute</i>, because the raging of Joyce, like the happier or calmer moods of the other writers, seems essentially fantastic, and lacks the note for which we shall be listening soon.</p>
			<p>We must pursue this notion of mythology further, and more circumspectly.</p>
